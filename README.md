#Sportdec code challenge

##Introduction
Welcome to the Sportdec coding challenge. The challenge is intended for candidates applying for development roles in our company. It's not a super-charged time challenge - you can complete it at home, in your own time. Ideally you will complete this in less than 1 week - the sooner you get your submission to us, the sooner we can progess your application.

    A little bit about us
    Sportdec is a sports companion app for sports fans. What's a sports companion app? 
    Well, we see it as providing fans with features and fun to compliment their 
    following of live games. That includes:
     * Realtime updates and notificaations on match scores and events :soccer:
     * Match, team and players stats
     * Orginal sport content of a fan's favourite teams
     * Pre- and live-match money wagering
     * Sports games
     * And much more...


##The Challenge
This assignment asks you to deliver a mobile web app that displays an overview of a real football match.
In this repo you'll find the JSON data that describes what happened in the match and when it happened. You'll also find image assets you might need to render an interesting user experience. Other than that, we are being deliberately non-specific on visual layout - that's up to you. That said, what we are looking for is a solution that clearly describes timeline of events for the match to the user - the chronology of events should tell the user all she needs to understand what happened in the game and when.

Technically, you're solution should do the following:
● Demonstrate the use services or controllers that interact with the json files as the data source for the interface
● Demonstrate the implementation of styles in a way that is easy to manage, change and reuse into the future.
● Demonstrate the sorting and ordering of match events from the JSON source
● Demonstrate good file and code structure

## Submission
Please begin by forking this repository (or simply clone it if you do not want to submit using GitHub). To submit, add the following users as collaborators:

@onlydave  
@cusackd  
@ikerSportdec  
@Wogiebear  

If you don't wish to use GitHub for submission, add the project files to a suitable directory on Google Drive and share, or zip the project and send as an email attachment, to the following email
addresses:

conor.wogan@sportdec.com  
iker@sportdec.com   
daveb@sportdec.com  
davec@sportdec.com  

When submitting, ideally replace this README.md with whatever documentation you choose to accompany your work.

## Prescribed languages and tools
You are free to choose the technologies you wish to use to implement this challenge. However, given the nature of the role, the following are preferable.

 * JavaScript, in particular AngularJS or similar client side framework.
 * SASS/LESS or some CSS preprocessor
 * A build system such as gulp, grunt or webpack, see below.

## Non-functional requirements 
Ideally we would like the project to have its dependencies resolved with `npm`, `bower`, `yarn` or some combination of the above, and for us to be able to launch it with something along the lines of `npm start` (or another single command).
